## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a historian who works at Florida State University. I work at the medical school. I research the history of drugs and related technologies, the pharmaceutical industry, public health, and related topics. I don't know much about coding but I'm starting to work with people who do. So feel free to reach out if you might be interested in collaborating with someone who spends most of their time in the past.  :upside_down_face:
